# Angular2 Seed MVVM
A seed project for Angular 2 apps (in MVVM)

It is something similar to the [Angular2 Seed Repository](https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed).

**Note:** Angular 2.0 is not production ready yet! This seed project is perfect for playing around with the latest versions but do not start new projects with it since a lot of new changes are going to be introduced until the framework is officially released.

# How to start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xnramx/Angular2-Seed-MVVM.git
cd Angular2-Seed-MVVM.
npm install
# New Project
chmod +x config.sh
./config.sh <AppName>
cd <AppName>/Development
gulp serve.dev
```
